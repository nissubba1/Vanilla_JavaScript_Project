## 1. Color Flipper
A simple random background color changer when user click on a button. This project uses Python to scrap all the color names and their hex values from Wikipedia's List of colors. There are total of 265 different colors. The aim was to give user unique and different background colors and create user-friendly UI.

### Process:
I used Python BeautifulSoup4 to scrap Wikipedia color names and hex values. After that, I wrote it in a JSON file 
using key-value pair. Then, using JavaScript fetch method, read the JSON file and used it to change background color.

## 2. Random Gift Assign
It is end of October and start of a holiday season. During holiday, everyone wants to give someone a gift; however, 
many do not know what to give. Which is why I wrote this program.

### Instruction:
1. Write everyone who you want to give gift
2. Click on the 'Assign' button and program will randomly assign gifts from list of available gifts
3. If you don't like those randomly assigned gifts, click on 'Shuffle' button, and it will shuffle the gifts again
4. Click on the 'Reset' to reset the gifts

## 3. Counter

A simple program that can count and changes color based on if current number is positive or negative. 

The 3 buttons makes it easy to use the program. User can increase, decrease, or reset the number at any time.

## 4. Review Carousel
A testimonial section of the web page made to be user-friendly and unique. The buttons are all fully functional. 

### Interesting: 
If you click on the 'Surprise Me' button, the JavaScript will get a random index and give you that index review 
information.
