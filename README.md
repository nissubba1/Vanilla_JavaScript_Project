# JavaScript Projects
## 1. Color Flipper
A simple random background color changer when user click on a button. This project uses Python to scrap all the color names and their hex values from Wikipedia's List of colors. There are total of 265 different colors. The aim was to give user unique and different background colors and create user-friendly UI.

### Process:
I used Python BeautifulSoup4 to scrap Wikipedia color names and hex values. After that, I wrote it in a JSON file 
using key-value pair. Then, using JavaScript fetch method, read the JSON file and used it to change background color.
